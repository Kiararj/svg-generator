# SVG Generator
## Description

This project was built to generate a quick SVG logo with three characters. I learned about using classes for objects in JavaScript, more on using the inquirer npm package, and how to create tests using Jest.

## Installation

To use this command line application open your Terminal and run npm install to install the required dependencies.

## Usage

This command line application is used to generate an SVG logo with three letters. Answer the four questions you are prompted with to customize your logo's color and 
shape. Demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17tq8ksrTj_Q81zeImBttga2Q1OFNHDMh/view?usp=sharing

## Credits

Received help from TA, Jose Lopez.

## Tests

To run tests for this application, open the terminal and run npm test to make sure the Circle, Triangle, and Square shapes are rendered correctly.
